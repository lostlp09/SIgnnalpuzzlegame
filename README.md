This game was made with Godot:
  blocks wich are connected together and with  startblock are childs of startblock and if you press start:
  every block which is inside of startblock are going to get called seperatly until they are done ,so the next one can start
  each block has their own group,so the game can easily check what the function of the block is.
  This game was supposed to have a loop ,but i couldnt make it on time ,but this game is defently playable with out it
